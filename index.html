        <p>
            Ygt is a program for hinting TrueType fonts. Written in Python, it is cross-platform, and will
            run equally well on Windows, the Mac, and Linux. It requires Python 3.10: other dependencies will
            be installed automatically when you install with pip, the package-management tool for Python.
        </p>
        <p>
            The program is designed to be fast and friendly. Where other programs require that you refer to
            points, control values, and functions by number, ygt names control values, functions, and other
            features, and it allows you to name points and sets of points. All of its major commands have 
            one-key shortcuts so that you can work quickly, with one hand on the keyboard and one on the
            mouse. And it is up to date, emphasizing the kinds of hinting required for modern displays while
            deemphsizing those that are rarely needed or obsolete.
