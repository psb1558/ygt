        <h1>Tutorial for the <span class="ygt">ygt</span> hint editor</h1>
        <p>
            This tutorial assumes that you understand what TrueType hinting is and what 
            it is for. It also assumes that you have succeeded
            in downloading and launching <span class="ygt">ygt</span>. If the first of these
            things is not true, read the 
            <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/truetype/hinting">introduction 
            to TrueType hinting</a> at the Microsoft Typography site. If the second is not
            true, consult the “Getting Started” section of the document
            <a href="https://github.com/psb1558/ygt/blob/main/docs/YGT-intro.pdf">YGT-Intro.pdf</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>The <span class="ygt">ygt</span> window</h2>
        <p>
            Start a hinting project by launching <span class="ygt">ygt</span> and opening either a TrueType
            font or a UFO. For this tutorial we’ll open the variable version of
            the <a href="https://github.com/psb1558/Elstob-font">Elstob font</a> 
            (the very font in which this document is set), which will enable us to demonstrate both basic
            hinting techniques and advanced techniques relating to variable fonts.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you first load a font, the <span class="ygt">ygt</span> main window looks like this:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_01.png" style="width: 90%;">
        <p>
            This window is divided into five panes. On the right is the graphical
            editor, where you will do most of your work. In the middle is the code
            pane. <span class="ygt">ygt</span> stores hints and other data in files in the YAML
            serialization language, and the code pane displays this YAML code. You
            can edit the code directly, though most of the time it will be faster
            and easier to use the graphical editor.*
            <span class="boxtext">*You can
                find a reference for <span class="ygt">ygt</span>’s very simple hinting language in the 
                document <a href="https://github.com/psb1558/ygt/blob/main/docs/YGT-intro.pdf">YGT-Intro.pdf</a>.</span>
            On the left are two preview
            panes. The one on the top shows a blown-up version of the current
            glyph as it will be rendered on screen, with the current collection of
            hints applied. You can view this glyph at various resolutions (in
            pixels per inch) and in various rendering modes, and you can view it
            in black-on-white or white-on-black. If you are hinting a variable
            font, you can preview any instance. All of these choices can be made
            from the “Preview” menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beneath the big preview pane is one that by default shows the current 
            glyph in an array of resolutions beginning with 10ppem:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_02.png" style="width: 40%;"/>
        <p>
            The current resolution (25ppem is the default) is underlined in red;
            click on any instance to display that resolution in the large pane
            above. If you want to see a glyph in context, type something (perhaps
            a favorite pangram) into the “Text” box and hit the Enter key or click
            “Submit”: the text will appear in the current resolution and in the
            current instance:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_03.png" style="width: 40%;"/>
        <p>
            By choosing options on the “Preview” menu, you can choose the script 
            and language for this text, and you can apply any of your font’s OpenType 
            features—for example, small caps:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_04.png" style="width: 40%;"/>
        <p>
            The ability to apply scripts, languages, and features enables you
            to get a preview of any glyph in context.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the top of the <span class="ygt">ygt</span> window is a row of buttons. Some of these are
            for adding hints (more on these later), while others are for managing CVs, changing the
            behavior of the pointer, and choosing the hinting direction (though
            modern fonts are usually hinted only on the y axis).
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two more important windows to mention before we go on. 
            One is the “Font Viewer,” which displays all the glyphs of the font:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_05.png" style="width: 50%;"/>
        <p>
            You can filter the display by typing any part of a glyph name. For 
            example, typing “eight” in the “Filter” box causes the Font Viewer 
            to display all variants of the number eight:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_06.png" style="width: 50%;"/>
        <p>
            Glyphs that are already hinted are highlighted in blue; composite 
            glyphs (which can’t be edited in <span class="ygt">ygt</span>) are highlighted in gold. The 
            current glyph is outlined in red.
        </p>
        <p>
            Go to any glyph by clicking on it in the Font Viewer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next is the “Font Info” window:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_07.png" style="width: 60%;"/>
        <p>
            This allows you to manage all of the font’s control values (CVs),*
            <span class="boxtext">*A control value is an integer stored in 
            an array in the font. It is used by anchor and stem hints to
            position points on the grid and regulate distances.
            </span>
            which in <span class="ygt">ygt</span>
            are named rather than numbered. Here you can also manage the masters
            of variable fonts, which correspond to the masters you produced when
            designing the font, and the variant CVs associated with those
            masters. We’ll have much more to say about managing CVs later on in
            this tutorial.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also manage defaults for the current font on the 
            “Defaults” tab of the Font Info window.
        </p>
        <h2>Setting up for hinting</h2>
        <p>
            Before we start to hint this font, we should customize the workspace. By
            default, the graphical editor shows all of a glyph’s points: on-curve
            points are red circles, and off-curve points are slightly smaller blue
            circles. It is quite possible to apply hints to off-curve points, but
            I strongly suggest that you hint only on-curve points. If you decide to follow
            this advice, you can suppress the display of off-curve points by
            right-clicking anywhere in the graphical editor and selecting “Hide
            off-curve points” from the context menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            It normally isn’t necessary to display point labels while editing, 
            but if you want them for any reason, select “Show point labels” from 
            the context menu:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_08.png" style="width: 60%;"/>
        <p>
            In a TrueType font, glyph outlines are defined by a zero-based array
            of points. Most TrueType hint editors require that you refer to points
            using indexes into this array. Unfortunately, these point numbers are
            unstable. If you switch font editors, the new editor will probably
            number points differently. If you make even minor edits in a glyph,
            you will very likely cause the glyph’s points to be renumbered. If
            you do either of these things after you’ve begun hinting, the result will be chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
            One way around this problem is to display point labels as coordinates 
            rather than indexes. Select “On-curve labels as coordinates” from the 
            context menu to switch to this mode:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_09.png" style="width: 40%;"/>
        <p>
            Now the code generated by <span class="ygt">ygt</span> will refer to points by their
            coordinates rather than their indexes, and <span class="ygt">ygt</span> will translate these
            coordinates into indexes at compile time. Since font apps will not
            move on-curve points even if you add points, move off-curve
            points, or change editors, coordinates can be more stable than
            indexes. If you switch the display from indexes to coordinates and
            then hide point labels, coordinates will still be inserted in your
            code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neither coordinates nor indexes are particularly mnemonic, but you 
            can name points if you like. If you name just a few key points, they 
            will make it easy to spot the sections of your code dealing with the 
            various features of a glyph.
        </p>
        <p>
            To name a point, select* <span class="boxtext">*To select a point, click
                or drag over it. Selected points are filled with gray.
            </span> it, right click in the graphical editor, and 
            select “Name selected point” from the context menu. Type a name in 
            the dialog that appears. The name will show in the graphical editor:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_10.png" style="width: 40%;"/>
        <p>
            If  you name a point while point labels are displayed as indexes, 
            the name will serve as an alias for an index; otherwise it will serve 
            as an alias for a coordinate-pair.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="ygt">ygt</span> does a good bit of setup for you the first time you open a
            font. It analyzes the font and builds a short list of CVs,
            each of which is accompanied by a good bit of information, as you can see 
            in the entry for “xheight”:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_11.png" style="width: 60%;"/>
        <dl>
            <dt>name</dt>
            <dd>
                <span class="ygt">ygt</span> names CVs rather than requiring that you memorize their indexes. 
                You supply a name when you create a CV, but the name can’t be changed 
                afterwards—except by editing the code.
            </dd>
            <dt>val</dt>
            <dd>
                A number in font units. For CVs of this type (see next item), this 
                value is an absolute position on the current axis.
            </dd>
            <dt>type</dt>
            <dd>
                This can be “pos” (for “position”) or “dist” (for distance). A “pos” 
                CV is an absolute position of a point on the grid, while a “dist” CV 
                is the distance between two points.
            </dd>
            <dt>axis</dt>
            <dd>
                This can be “x” or “y.” Hinting for most fonts is now done only on the y axis.
            </dd>
            <dt>cat</dt>
            <dd>
                The category of character that this CV applies to.<span class="boxtext">*Unencoded
                    glyphs have no Unicode category, but <span class="ygt">ygt</span> can 
                    usually guess at one.
                </span> All of the encoded glyphs in 
                a font belong to a Unicode category (e.g. “Letter, uppercase” or “Symbol, 
                currency”).* Selecting a category here signals that this CV applies only to 
                characters in that category.
            </dd>            
            <dt>suffix</dt>
            <dd>
                Some classes of characters do not correspond to the Unicode categories, 
                but can be identified by suffixes (like <span class="code">.sc</span> or 
                <span class="code">.smcp</span> for small caps). If 
                you enter a value here, this CV will apply only to characters with the 
                specified suffix.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
            A CV can be made equal to another CV at specified sizes. For an example, 
            select “xheight-overshoot” in the list of CVs and click over to the “Same as” tab:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_12.png" style="width: 60%;"/>
        <p>
            Here the CV “xheight-overshoot” is made equal to the “xheight” CV when
            the current resolution is less than 40ppem. (The same can be done when
            the current resolution is above a certain value, but this will be
            rarer.) The normal use of this feature is to equalize approximately
            equal CVs at low resolutions, so that, for example, characters with
            overshoot (like <span class="ltr">o</span>) don’t appear too much higher or lower than characters
            without overshoot (like <span class="ltr">x</span>). In this example (at 18ppem), the top line
            does not set the two CVs equal and the bottom line does:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_13.png" style="width: 40%;"/>
        <p>
            By default, the two CVs specified here are set equal below 40ppem, but 
            you should experiment with this threshold number to get the best result for each 
            pair of CVs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first time you open a variable font, <span class="ygt">ygt</span> builds a list of masters. 
            These will usually match the masters you created when designing the font, 
            but you can add to, subtract from, and edit this list:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_14.png" style="width: 60%;"/>
        <p>
            It is beyond the scope of this tutorial to explain the numbers that
            define each master, but you need
            to know that each master can have variant CVs associated
            with it. Notice also the “Generate Variant
            Control Values” button: we will return later to the subject of variant
            CVs and of this button.
            You can see the variant CVs associated with a variable font’s masters on the “Variants” pane of the
            “Control Values” tab:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_15.png" style="width: 60%;"/>
        <p>
            The default value of the “xheight” CV is 435, and it is the same for
            all the masters for which the value is “None.” But the masters
            “opsz-min” and “opsz-max” (for “Minimum Optical Size” and “Maximum
            Optical Size”) have different values for this CV, which rendering
            engines will interpolate whenever the Optical Size changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will discuss the “Deltas” pane in another tutorial.
        </p>
        <h2>Hinting the letter <span class="ltr">A</span></h2>
        <p>
            The operation of the graphical editor will be intuitive to anyone who 
            has used a font or vector editor. To add a hint, select one or more points and 
            click one of these buttons (or use a shortcut key):
        </p>
        <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li>
                <img src="./images/tut_16_stem_hint_button.jpg" class="bulletimg"/>
                Stem hint (shortcut <b>T</b>). This type of hint regulates the distance
                between a reference and a target point. By default, the distance is
                rounded: if the reference point is aligned to the grid, the target
                point will also be aligned to the grid. Also by default, a minimum
                distance of one pixel is maintained between the reference and the
                target point. This can be turned off; or a distance of less or more
                than one pixel can be specified in the code. For precise control, 
                a stem hint can use a CV; but this is not usually necessary in 
                modern hinting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="./images/tut_17_shift_hint_button.jpg"  class="bulletimg"/>
                Shift hint (<b>H</b>). This moves one or more target points by exactly as
                much as a reference point has been moved. If rounding is on for this
                hint, all target points will then (after initial positioning) be
                rounded to the grid.
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="./images/tut_18_align_hing_button.jpg" class="bulletimg"/>
                Align hint (<b>L</b>). This moves one or more target points so that they are 
                aligned on the current axis with a reference point. If rounding is on 
                for this hint, all target points will then be aligned to the grid. Align 
                hints are generally less useful than the others.
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="./images/tut_19_interp_hint_button.jpg" class="bulletimg"/>
                Interpolate hint (<b>I</b>). This moves one or more target points so that their 
                position relative to two reference points is proportionally the same as 
                in the original glyph. As with the shift and align hints, rounding (if requested) is 
                done after the target points are moved.
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="./images/tut_20_anchor_hint_button.jpg" class="bulletimg"/>
                Anchor hint (<b>A</b>). This moves a point to a specific position on the grid. 
                The position may be specified with a CV; if not, the point’s destination 
                is its current position. By default, the point’s position is rounded so 
                that it will always land on a grid line. If neither a CV nor rounding is 
                applied, the point is merely “touched”—that is, marked as having been 
                affected by a hint. Being touched protects the point from being inadvertently 
                moved by later instructions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Let’s start hinting at the bottom of the glyph.<span class="boxtext">*If a point
                is both rounded and selected, the fill is dark pink (or a pink-tinted gray).
            </span> You must always begin a
            sequence of hints with an anchor hint. Select the bottom-left point
            (which we named “bottom” earlier) by clicking on it or dragging over
            it, and click the “Anchor hint” button or type <b>A</b>. The point will be
            highlighted in pink and filled with a lighter pink. The pink
            highlighting tells us that an anchor hint has been applied to this
            point, and the light pink fill tells us that the hint is rounded.*
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_21.png" style="width: 40%;"/>
        <p>
            We should apply a CV to this hint: it is not strictly necessary here,
            but it’s a good idea to use CVs for hints that position points at
            specific places on the grid, if only for the sake of your code’s
            legibility. Right click on the “bottom” point, select “Set control
            value” from the context menu, and choose “baseline” from the list of
            CVs (only CVs that can be applied to this hint in this glyph appear
            on the menu):
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_22.png" style="width: 50%;"/>
        <p>
            In the code pane, these lines have appeared. Together they make up a 
            hint instruction:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_23.png" style="width: 40%;"/>
        <p>
            Those who know the YAML language will recognize the hyphen as marking
            this instruction as a list item (a glyph program is a list of top-level
            hints with their dependent hints): it consists of two key-value
            pairs. “ptid” stands for “point identifier”: it can be a single point
            or a list of points. “pos” stands for “position”: it identifies its
            value as a position-type CV. If the point were not already positioned
            on the baseline (if, for example, another instruction caused it to be
            nudged away), the “baseline” CV would cause it to be moved there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most hint instructions in the code pane will also contain a “rel” key, 
            which specifies how the target point or points are to be positioned 
            relative to the reference point or points. Since an anchor hint is not 
            positioned relative to any other point, the “rel” key is omitted here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next we should regulate the thickness of the serif.<span class="boxtext">*A 
                highlighted point like this one can’t 
                be selected by clicking on it: that selects the hint that has been 
                applied to it. Instead, drag over the point to select it.
            </span> In the days of
            CRT displays, we
            used a rounded stem hint with CV for this, but when working
            on a font for a modern display, it is better to use an
            unrounded stem hint without a CV. To do this, select the “bottom”
            point* and point 19,25,
            and click the “Stem hint” button or type the
            shortcut <b>T</b>:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_24.png" style="width: 40%;"/>
        <p>
            The stem hint is marked with a red arrow running from the reference
            point “bottom” to the point at coordinates 19,25. You can see from the
            pink fill for point 19,25 that this hint is rounded: to unround it,
            right-click on the hint (the button in the middle of the arrow’s stem
            provides a convenient thing to click on). On the context menu, you
            will see that the item “Round target point” is checked: select this to
            unround it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The hints we have applied so far make little visible difference to the 
            rendered glyph—at least not at 25ppem. If you look closely, you can see
            that the left serif has become a little darker:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_25.png" style="width: 60%;"/>
        <p>
            The hinting will make a bigger difference at other resolutions. We need 
            to hint the right-hand serif to match the one on the left. We could apply 
            the same hints we used for the left-hand serif to the one on the right, 
            but it is better to use shift hints here. Select a hinted point 
            on the left and an equivalent point on the right and click the shift-hint 
            button or type the shortcut <b>H</b>. Do this for each of the hinted points:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_26.png" style="width: 60%;"/>
        <p>
            Now let’s hint the top of the letter. For the “top” point we’ll need
            an anchor hint with CV. It is not necessary to add the hint and the CV
            with separate operations; instead, hold down the Control or Command
            key while adding the hint to make <span class="ygt">ygt</span> guess at the correct CV by
            choosing the CV with a position closest to that of the target
            point. (You can make <span class="ygt">ygt</span> guess at a CV for an existing hint by
            clicking the “Guess Control Value” button (yellow with a question mark
            in a C), by typing a question mark as a shortcut key, or by selecting
            “Guess” from the list of CVs on the context menu.)
        </p>
        <p>
            With a single action, we have anchored the point “top” and applied the 
            “cap-height-overshoot” CV (since the A is a little higher than most other 
            capitals). We should also regulate the position of the left-hand diagonal 
            relative to the “top” point. To do this, connect “top” with one of the  
            points at the top of the diagonal with a shift-hint:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_27.png" style="width: 40%;"/>
        <p>
            But our hinting of the top of the A has caused a problem at the bottom, 
            where (at certain resolutions) the ends of the diagonals have been pushed
            out beyond the bottom of the letter:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_28.png" style="width: 25%;"/>
        <p>
            To fix this, we need to regulate the bottoms of the diagonals. There is 
            more than one way to do this; I suggest using an interpolate-hint to force 
            the relevant points back to their original mid-serif positions. Select the 
            two points we hinted in the bottom-left serifs, then one point at the bottom 
            of each diagonal; then click the “Interpolate-hint” button or type <b>I</b>:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_29.png" style="width: 50%;"/>
        <p>
            It’s getting a little crowded at the bottom of the glyph, but you can
            see that yellow arrows now run from the two points we hinted at the
            beginning of this process to a box containing two points highlighted
            in yellow. The box identifies the two points as a set: the
            interpolate-hint operates on all the members of this set. Now the
            problem with the diagonals is fixed:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_30.png" style="width: 25%;"/>
        <p>
            We still need to hint the bar of the A. Select the “top” and “bottom” 
            points, then the “bar” point, and hold down the shift key while clicking 
            the “interpolate-hint” button or typing <b>I</b>: the “bar” point (the bottom-left 
            point in the bar) will be interpolated and rounded to the grid:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_31.png" style="width: 40%;"/>
        <p>
            The last thing we need to do is regulate the top of the bar. We’ll need an 
            unrounded stem hint with no CV—the kind we used for the serif. In fact, almost all the stems in this font 
            will be regulated in the same way, with unrounded hints. So rather than 
            unrounding every stem hint after we add it, lets change the default behavior 
            of these stems. To do this, bring up the “Font Info” box and click over to 
            the “Rounding” pane of the “Defaults” tab:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_31a.png" style="width: 60%;"/>
        <p>
            Uncheck the “Stem” box to make sure that every stem hint is unrounded when
            first added (you can always change a hint’s rounding later). Now return
            to the graphical editor and add a stem hint from “bar” to point 
            183,251:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_33.png" style="width: 40%;"/>
        <p>
            The bottom of the bar will appear sharp, being rounded to the grid, 
            and the top will be anti-aliased—an effect that you can see more clearly 
            (for both the bar and the serifs) at higher resolutions:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_34.png" style="width: 25%;"/>
        <h2>Saving your work</h2>
        <p>
            I’m going to hint one more glyph, but before we do that, let’s save our
            work. To do so, simply type <b>Ctrl-S</b> or <b>Cmd-S</b>, as in other
            applications. If you started your project by opening a TrueType font,
            <span class="ygt">ygt</span> will save your work in a separate file with the same name as the
            font you opened, but with the suffix <span class="code">.yaml</span> 
            instead of <span class="code">.ttf</span>. If you
            started by opening a UFO, your work will be saved in the UFO as
            <span class="code">/data/org.ygthinter/source.yaml</span> (if you want to change from UFO to
            <span class="code">.ttf</span> mode, simply copy this file out of the UFO, rename it, and edit
            the first line to point to a TrueType font). When you return to the
            project, open up the <span class="code">.yaml</span> file, not the 
            <span class="code">.ttf</span>; or simply open the UFO
            again.
        </p>
        <h2>The letter <span class="ltr">i</span></h2>
        <p>
            I’ll conclude the tutorial by walking you through hinting the letter <span class="ltr">i</span>. 
            The  main part of the character (the “base”) is easy, given what you’ve learned so far:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Anchor point 0 to the baseline by selecting and typing <b>Ctrl-A</b>.</li>
            <li>Add point 1 to the selection and type <b>T</b> to regulate the thickness of the serif.</li>
            <li>Select points 1 and 18 and type <b>H</b> to regulate the right side of the serif.</li>
            <li>Select point 11 and type <b>Ctrl-A</b> to hint the top of the minim.</li>
            <li>Add point 10 to the selection and type <b>T</b>; then right-click on the 
                hint and select “Minimum distance” from the context menu, unchecking it.
                This will position the left side of the beak.</li>
            <li>Select points 9 and 10 and type <b>T</b> to keep the beak from disappearing
                at low resolutions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Here is the result:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_35.png" style="width: 25%;"/>
        <p>
            All that’s left now is the dot. The complication is that on the
            Optical Size axis of this variable font, the xheight varies—high at
            the minimum value and low at the maximum—and the height of diacritics
            (like the dot of the <span class="ltr">i</span>) varies with it. Yet it is important to assign
            a CV for diacritics, since they vary in height (for
            example, an acute sits significantly lower than a macron) in a way
            that might look bad at low resolutions. For the base value of this CV,
            we should choose a position about halfway between the highest
            diacritic in the font (the macron, at 556) and the lowest (the acute at 521).
        </p>
        <p>
            When creating a CV, it is best, whenever possible, to base it on an existing
            point rather than type a number in the “val” box.*<span class="boxtext">*Basing
                a CV on an existing point allows <span class="ygt">ygt</span> to determine
                the values of variant CVs.
            </span> When we search through the font’s collection of diacritics for
            a suitable point, we find the combining breve (<span class="code">uni0306</span>), whose
            lowest point, at 541, is almost exactly what we want.
            Navigate to this glyph in <span class="ygt">ygt</span>,
            select the lowest on-curve point, type <b>C</b>,
            and enter the name “diacritic-height” for the new CV:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_35a.png" style="width: 50%;"/>
        <p>
            Now bring up the “Font Info” window, click over to the “Masters” tab,
            and click the “Generate Variant Control Values” button. A busy icon
            will appear for a few seconds. When it disappears, click over to the
            “Control Values” tab, double-click “diacritic-height” in the list of
            CVs, and then click over to the “Variants” pane:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/tut_36.png" style="width: 60%;"/>
        <p>
            As you can see, values have been added for the “opsz-min” and “opsz-max” 
            masters (you can check these values in 
            a font editor, but I promise that <span class="ygt">ygt</span> has gotten them right).
            Masters with the value "None" will use the default value of 541.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now return to the letter <span class="ltr">i</span>, select the bottommost point in the dot, and 
            type <b>Ctrl-A</b>. As you can see in the code pane, an anchor hint with CV 
            “diacritic-height” has been added. Add the topmost point of the dot to 
            the selection, type <b>T</b>, and we’re done with the letter <span class="ltr">i</span>!
        </p>
