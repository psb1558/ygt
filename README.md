# Ygt

**Ygt** is a Python app for hinting TrueType fonts. It is built to be fast, flexible, and free:

- it will run equally well under Windows, Mac OS, and Linux;
- it emphasizes modern requirements for TrueType hinting while backgrounding the obsolete;
- the most common commands use unmodified shortcut keys so you can work quickly with one hand on the keyboard and one on the mouse;
- it will read either a TrueType font or a UFO;
- it can save hints in an easily understood and edited YAML file,
- which can be compiled to a hinted font either from inside the program or from the command line,
- or it can save compiled hints to a UFO (from which fontmake can produce a hinted font)

Ygt is in an alpha state, with features yet to be added (especially auto-hinting). But it is already a workable program, which the developer has used to hint thousands of glyphs in several large fonts.
